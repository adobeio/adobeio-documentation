# Photo Rights

The Sign APIs can also be used for scenarios involving in-person signing. Consider an example wherein you need to get the photo publishing rights of a celebrity. You can use the in-person signing technique to simplify the signing process for the celebrity.

The steps involved are:

1. [Upload the legal document](../api_uasge/send_signing.md) containing the terms and conditions involving photo publishing. 
2. Create an agreement and [get the signing URL](../api_uasge/get_signing_url.md) for the agreement. Load the signing URL in a mobile device and get it signed from the celebrity, in-person.
3. Once the celebrity signs, [download the signed agreement](../api_uasge/download_agreement.md).
